Detailed course requirements for the MS ITM degree may be found in the following section. To apply for this degree program, an undergraduate degree is required (all majors are considered). Students must maintain a 3.0 grade-point average (GPA) in both core courses and in all graduate courses taken in the degree program, excluding program prerequisites to qualify for the MS degree. Prerequisite Students pursuing the Master of Science in Information Technology Management degree program are required to complete one semester credit hour of MAS 6102 Professional Development course. Degree credit is not earned for program prerequisites, however, the grade achieved in prerequisites will count toward the student's grade-point average (GPA).
