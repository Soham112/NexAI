🧠 UTD Course Job Insight Agent

The UTD Course Job Insight Agent is an intelligent, agent-based system that bridges the gap between university coursework and industry job requirements.
By integrating real-time job postings with academic course data, the system helps students identify which courses best align with current market demands and career goals.

🚀 Overview

Students often struggle to understand how their academic coursework connects to real-world career opportunities.
This project addresses that challenge by developing a multi-agent framework that gathers, cleans, and analyzes both academic and job market data.
The solution leverages Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for natural-language interaction and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver personalized, data-driven insights.

🧩 System Architecture

The architecture consists of three main components:

1. Job Market Agent

Scrapes live job postings from company career boards using Greenhouse URLs.

Extracts key fields such as title, responsibilities, required skills, salary range, and location.

Stores data in structured JSON format under raw/ (HTML) and clean/ (processed) folders in Amazon S3.

2. Course Catalog Agent

Crawls the official UTD Course Catalog and UTD Trends Dashboard.

Extracts and enriches course data (course ID, title, description, popularity, and offering terms).

Stores HTML data in raw/ and cleaned datasets in clean/ for ingestion into the knowledge base.

3. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Integration

Connects cleaned datasets to an Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base (KB).

Uses vector embeddings for semantic retrieval and contextual reasoning.

Employs the Strands framework and a custom course_kb_search tool to allow natural-language queries like:

“Which UTD courses focus on data analytics and cloud computing?”

🧠 Key Features

🔍 Semantic Search: Retrieve contextually similar results even with different phrasing.

🤖 Agent-Based Architecture: Independent agents handle catalog scraping, job data collection, and reasoning.

💬 Natural-Language Interaction: Users can ask questions conversationally via Bedrock AgentCore.

☁️ Cloud-Native Design: Uses AWS services for storage, scalability, and secure integration.

📊 Data Transparency: All responses are traceable to their original S3 source files.

🧮 Running the Agents Locally
a) Run the Job Market Agent
python3 Job_Market_Agent/main_job.py --s3 --s3-bucket nexai-job-market-data --aws-region us-east-1

b) Run the Course Catalog Agent
python3 Course_Catalog_Agent/utd_Trends_scrape.py --out-root data --no-headless

c) Launch AgentCore
agentcore invoke '{"inputText": "Show me UTD courses related to data analytics"}' --agent CourseMatchAI
